    This interface uses IQueryable<T> to allow a caller to obtain a sequence of Product objects. The IQueryable<T> interface is
derived from the more familiar IEnumerable<T> interface and represents a collection of objects that can be queried, such as those
managed by a database.
    A class that depends on the IProductRepository interface can obtain Product objects without needing to know the details of
how they are stored or how the implementation class will deliver them
